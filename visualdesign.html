	  <H2> Artifact #1</h2>
	  
	  <img src=sana.png>
    <p>I chose this celebrity because she’s from one of my favorite kpop groups and she is very liked and I like her singing. Her name is Sana from a kpop group called Twice. I learned about her because of a friend I used to talk to throughout this year and she stuck with me and is still my favorite singer. </p>

	  <H2>Artifact #2</h2>

<img src=rawr.png>
    <p>I used the tools by making pixels first and then switching between the eraser and pencil tool. I started by finding an image similar to what I wanted to do and had a template to see what I could do. My character looks like the duck holding the knife meme. My character is wearing nothing because hes a duck and hes holding a pencil while having a tophat on. I would like him to be in a roblox game.

    <h2>Artifact #3</h2>
    <img src=kale.png>
    <p>I first got an image of something and then I started pressing the buttons that my teacher told me to press and then I was able to duplicate the image over and over again. After I duplicated the image, I was able to make it look into a kaleidoscope and I proceeded to add a filter over it to make it look the way I wanted it to. It turned out into this pale kaleidoscope and it turned out great.</p>

    <h2> Artifact #4</h2>

    <img src=beasts.png>
    <p>I came up with this idea because I was looking at my friend and I thought of an alpaca then I saw my class and thought of a snake. My animal has a strong head and has the power to glide and sweep people off their feet. I turned it into a hybrid by making its body attached to the snake tail.</p>

    <h2>Artifact #5</h2>
    <img src=mystery.png>
    <p>I used the program adobe express to make a collage of the things that i like and that match my vibe. I started by finding images on pinterest and toggling a few things in between.I used pictures that were related to me or has a grainy feeling because I feel like that’s the vibe that I give off. I included pictures off pinterest because I already saved some things on there and the suggestions it gave me were accurate and were the kinds of pictures I was looking for. I think my collage matches my aesthetic because it has the things I have or the things I relate to and the things that interest me. </p>
